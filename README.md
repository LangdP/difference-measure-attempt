# Difference measure

This repo hosts the files that have been used to compute the $M$ measure in chapter 8 of my dissertation. The scripts themselves are not usable without the data, which consists in `.csv` files generated from the word2vec models presented in the thesis containing, for a given word, the entire list of its averaged cosine similarities, along with their 95% intervals. 

Each folder contains a `.html` file written using `RMarkdown` to illustrate the computation. More information about this precise computation and its motivations can be found in those `.html` files as well as in chapter 8 of my dissertation.
